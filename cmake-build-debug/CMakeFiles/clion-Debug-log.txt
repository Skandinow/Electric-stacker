CMake Deprecation Warning:
  Support for "Extra Generators" like

    CodeBlocks

  is deprecated and will be removed from a future version of CMake.  IDEs may
  use the cmake-file-api(7) to view CMake-generated project build trees.

CMake Warning (dev) at C:/Users/ggelmetdinov/.vcpkg-clion/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake:859 (_find_package):
  Policy CMP0144 is not set: find_package uses upper-case <PACKAGENAME>_ROOT
  variables.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0144" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  CMake variable BOOST_ROOT is set to:

    C:/Program Files/boost/boost_1_87_0

  For compatibility, find_package is ignoring the variable, but code in a
  .cmake module might still use it.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
